<h2>Welcome To Our Community</h2>
<br>
<h4>Openness, empathy, and clarity.</h4>
<br><br>
<p> Each of us faces times of upheaval and stress.  We are often faced with a bewildering array of choices on a daily basis, and a technological environment that is fast-paced and all-pervasive. In our interactions with others, sometimes it is hard to find common ground. But it doesn’t have to be this way.<br><br>

If you feel some disconnection in your life taking place, we’re here to help. We created this Center and its programs with you in mind. ZLMC is a diverse Zen Buddhist Sangha in the White Plum tradition with people from all walks of life and many different religions, and we’re happy you’re here!<br><br>
Through its vision, mission, and values the Zen Life & Meditation Center seeks to cultivate a community of openness, generosity, and wisdom. <br><br>

The core values are intended to encourage each of us to continually examine the basic attitude and conduct necessary to live an authentic life of openness, empathy, and clarity. All members of the Center and active participants are assumed to be willing to abide by these core values for the benefit of themselves, for the ZLMC and its Sangha community, and for the welfare of others. It is through our efforts that mutual trust, respect, and the joy of practice will flourish in our Sangha.
